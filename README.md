# 3D Interactive Restaurant Project Timeline

This is an enhanced version of the Restaurant Booking System Project Timeline, featuring elegant 3D effects using Three.js.

## Features

- **Clean 3D Background**: Dynamic flowing waves and geometric shapes that respond to user movements
- **Responsive Timeline Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Scroll Animations**: Elements fade in as you scroll down the page
- **Interactive Elements**: 
  - Hover over phase headers for scaling effects
  - Hover over timeline nodes for highlight effects
  - Hover over achievement items for 3D rotation effects
  - Move your mouse across the screen to influence the 3D wave patterns

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5/CSS3**: Modern web standards with gradient effects and backdrop filters
- **Three.js**: JavaScript 3D library for creating flowing wave patterns and geometric shapes
- **GLSL Shaders**: Custom shader code for animated wave effects
- **FontAwesome**: For icons throughout the interface
- **Intersection Observer API**: For scroll-based animations

## How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open index.html in a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
3. No build steps or server required - it runs directly in the browser!

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Main HTML file with timeline structure
- `css/styles.css`: All styles for the project with modern CSS effects
- `js/script.js`: JavaScript code including Three.js implementation with custom GLSL shaders

## Design Elements

- **Wave Patterns**: Smooth flowing surfaces that respond to mouse movement
- **Geometric Objects**: Wireframe 3D shapes that float and rotate in the background
- **Glassmorphism**: Subtle blur effects on cards and headers for depth
- **Gradient Accents**: Smooth color transitions using the project's color palette
- **Subtle Animations**: Gentle movements throughout for an elegant experience

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome (recommended)
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge

Note: For the best experience, use a device with a mouse for the 3D interaction effects.

## Performance Considerations

The 3D effects are designed to be lightweight, but for optimal performance:

1. Use a modern browser with WebGL support
2. If animations seem sluggish, try reducing browser window size or closing other applications
3. The visual effects automatically adjust for mobile devices with reduced complexity
